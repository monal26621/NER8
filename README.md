Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to build a custom Named Entity Recognition model capable of identifying and extracting structured information such as person names, organizations, locations, or domain-specific entities from unstructured textual data. The task focuses on sequence labeling, where each token in a sentence is classified into predefined entity categories to enable automated information extraction and downstream NLP applications.

Data Type:
Unstructured text data consisting of sentences and documents that require linguistic preprocessing such as tokenization and annotation.

Dataset Used:
A custom annotated dataset where text samples are labeled with entity spans and tags. The dataset contains manually defined entity annotations used to train and evaluate the spaCy NER model.
